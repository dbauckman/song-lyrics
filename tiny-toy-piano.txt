I was head over heart over heels
For you as you knocked with your helmet and bike wheels
My grandma offered you cookies as she cleaned up our card game
You asked her how she was
She said "oh, about the same"

I said "I'm so sorry it must be so awful hard"

He said our love is like a 
Deep sea submarine
Getting down to the bottom of things
